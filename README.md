# SonosStream
An app for streaming YouTube and other media to Sonos devices.

In active development of a proof of concept. Stay tuned.


#### Setup
Currently this is a very early testing version of SonosStream. To use it one must install `ffmpeg` since there is no static library provided just yet.

To install ffmpeg you can use: `brew install ffmpeg`.

The app should run afterwards.
